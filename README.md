# MySQL-Employee-Tracker

![Project license badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen)

The goal was to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL. Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as Content Management Systems. 

The app involved building a command-line application that allows the user to:
* Add departments, roles, employees
* View departments, roles, employees
* Update employee roles
* Update employee managers
* View employees by manager
* Delete departments, roles, and employees
* View the total utilized budget of a department -- ie the combined salaries of all employees in that department

## User Story
```
As a business owner
